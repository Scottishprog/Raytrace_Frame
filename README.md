# Raytrace_Frame
## Purpose and inspiration
This GUI provides a frame to run and disply the results of the incoprorated ray tracing programs. The functionality is quite basic - there is only provision for selecting a program and running it. This allows you to have multiple different programs that can be selected an ran within the GUI.
This project was inspired by Ray Tracing from the Ground Up, wich had a base bit of software that set up the rendering and other support tasks, so the student could focus on the study of ray-tracing. The sample code was directly translated from C++ code from Ray Tracing in One Weekend.

## How To Use

## Future improvements
 - Add means to save and recall rendered images, associated with each program in the list.
 - Include the use of numba to reduce render times.
 - Add more render parameters to the GUI, including recursion depth, and rays per pixel.
